# kanban-task-manager

Following tutorial by FreeCodeCamp to build a Kanban task manager with updated toolkit.

## Changes from tutorial

The tutorial is a year old and the technologies used have been changed for this project. I will keep documenting the changes as I go along.

1. Next.js routing through the `App router` instead of the original `Page router`
2. Authentication through `Auth.js` instead of `Next-auth.js`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
